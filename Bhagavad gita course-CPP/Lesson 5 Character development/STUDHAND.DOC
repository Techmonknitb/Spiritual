Srila Prabhupada took this desire of his spiritual master to his heart and made this as the mission of his life.
\par    In order to execute the order of his spiritual master Srila Prabhupada decided to go to America. With great difficulty he managed to get a free ticket on a Scindia cargo ship going to Boston.
\par    Enroute to Boston Srila Prabhupada encountered great difficulty. He noted in his diary:
\par \ldblquote Rain, seasickness, dizziness, headache, no appetite, vomiting. \rdblquote The symptoms persisted, but it was more than seasickness. In two days he suffered two heart attacks. He tolerated the difficulties, knowing them to be temporary, while meditating on the purpose of his mission.
\par    Externally Srila Prabhupada was experiencing great inconveniences; he had been aboard ship for a month and had suffered heart attacks and repeated seasickness. Moreover, even if he were to recover from these difficulties, his arrival in America would undoubtedly bring many more difficulties. He was seventy years old, had no prior knowledge of America, no base of support and only Rs. 40/- in his pocket. But remembering the desire of his spiritual master and praying to Lord Krishna, Srila Prabhupada remained confident and determined.

\par     But then some young people who used to come to see Srila Prabhupada from downtown area of New York called Bowery advised Him to shift downtown as there were many young people interested in knowing about spiritual life.
\par     The Bowery was no place for a gentleman. It was the most corrupt place in the world. It is still known all over the world as skid row, a place of ruined and homeless alcoholics. At night, those without lodging slept on the sidewalks, doorsteps and street corners. Theft\rquote s were common place; a man\rquote s pockets might be searched ten or twenty times while he slept. The rates of hospitalization and death in the Bowery were five times higher than the national average, and many of the homeless bore the marks of recent injuries or violence.
\par      Inspite of all these dangers Srila Prabhupada decided to move to Bowery for preaching the message of Bhagavad Gita. He was totally fearless ! Srila Prabhupada later recalled \ldblquote  My friend was shocked to hear that I was moving to the Bowery but although I passed through many dangers, I never thought that, \lquote This is danger!\rquote .\rdblquote

Many of his disciples were also present and were giving Him respect as a bona-fide guru in a way which a Westerner is not familiar with.
\par     He was talking about the }{\i\f1\fs22 varnasrama dharma}{\f1\fs22  where the whole society is divided into four classes (}{\i\f1\fs22 sudra}{\f1\fs22 , }{\i\f1\fs22 vaisya, ksatriya & brahmana}{\f1\fs22 ) according to their aptitude and not by birth. Srila Prabhupada was telling that }{\i\f1\fs22 Brahmanas }{\f1\fs22 should be first class men  who intelligently lead the society. }{\i\f1\fs22 Ksatriyas}{\f1\fs22  are second class men who administer the government, }{\i\f1\fs22 Vaisyas}{\f1\fs22  are third class who do business and }{\i\f1\fs22 sudras}{\f1\fs22  are fourth class men who are dependent on others and work for them.

\par    One of the students from the crowd came forward and challenged \ldblquote  Oh! Then you must be a first class man, Swami?\rdblquote 
\par     When the question was translated into English to Srila Prabhupada, he became silent. There was nervous tittering among the students. One could feel the tension hung in the air. The silence continued for a while. Everyone was nervously waiting for the reply. One could see Srila Prabhupada had become more meditative. 
\par     Finally he replied in a grave tone, \ldblquote No! I am not 1st class. I am the servant of all the four classes. Actually, I am 5th class.\rdblquote 
\par     Even before the answer was translated back to the audience in French, just by his tone everyone had become respectful. He had shown his natural humility as a servant of God serving everyone to help make them a God-Conscious person.

\par }\pard \nowidctlpar\widctlpar\adjustright {\f1\fs22 
\par }\pard \nowidctlpar\widctlpar\adjustright {\f1\fs22 \tab Rupa could not believe what she saw. It was like a dream come true . As she held her father\rquote s hand tightly, following him through the throngs of people at the fair, she felt exhilarated at all that she saw and heard. It was just like all that she had read in the story books - the Ferris wheel was towering above the fair grounds, lit with different hues of lights that made a frenzied pattern as the wheel turned round and round. She heard children squealing with glee - and fear- as the wheel turned, and they were tossed  to and fro by its motion.
\par }\pard \nowidctlpar\widctlpar\adjustright {\f1\fs22 \tab Looking around her as they moved on, she noticed the stalls that lined the lanes of the fair grounds. There was a long row of stalls selling Oh!  so many kinds of lovely things
\par to eat  - piping hot pakoras and samosas, jalebis and gulab jamuns. Then there was the popcorn machine, popping little warm delicious smelling popcorns, which tickled her nose and made her mouth water. But before she could make her father hear her above din of  the hawkers and excited talking of the children and their parents, they moved on past the popcorn stall - to - what was this ? She was delighted when she realized they were at the ice cream stall, and she was struck with wonder at the varieties of ice cream on the counter. They were  of different colours and some of them had little chips of chocolate and raisins and pistas -  mixed in them. This, she couldn\lquote t resist. She looked up to tell father that she most certainly would not go any further if she did not have an ice cream, but to her horror, she saw that it was not Daddy who was towering over  her, but a  stranger. She looked around, desperately, overwhelmed at the number of people and the hustle of the crowd.
\par \tab It was twilight, Rupa was just 6 years old and 4 feet tall. She couldn\rquote t easily recognize the faces of those who passed by, and in total exasperation, she started to cry. Tears streamed down her little cheeks  and clouded her vision, but she was not looking at the people anymore. She could only see her dear father before her, in her mind\rquote s eye, and she couldn\rquote t find him in the crowd. She wailed in utter remorse, but nobody heard her because it was too noisy anyway. She was gripped with fear of being alone and lost.
\par \tab Suddenly a kind old man who was standing at the ice cream stall noticed Rupa crying and came towards her. \ldblquote What\rquote s the matter, little girl ? Oh, you\rquote re lost ? Don\rquote t worry, just wait with me and Daddy will come back soon and find you here.\rdblquote  \ldblquote But he won\rquote t know where to find me!\rdblquote  cried Rupa. \ldblquote Surely he\rquote ll remember where he lost you, so he\rquote ll come back here and look,\rdblquote  said the old man. He bought an ice cream for Rupa, but she did not even look at his out stretched arm with the coveted stick of delicious ice cream held in  it. She did not notice that it was the pink strawberry ice cream that only a short while ago had attracted her childish attention. She did not care even for the fluffy sugar cotton candy that the man held out in his other hand. The tears just flowed down her cheeks incessantly and she could only keep crying, \ldblquote Daddy! Daddy!\rdblquote 
\par \tab She feared the worst. What if Daddy went home, not able to find her ? Where would she spend the night ? What if the old man turned out to be a treacherous villain who stole children and cut their  arms and legs and took them away to far - away cities - to beg ? 
\par \tab She suddenly noticed somebody else was talking to her, and looked up to find a policeman,  with a kind voice, telling her not to cry and offering her a bright orange balloon. But Rupa was not impressed or delighted, as she would have normally been, because without Daddy her world seemed to have ended.
\par \tab Rupa almost fainted with helplessness, when she felt a familiar, warm hand grip hers and another squeeze her shoulder. She did not need to turn up and look into the face, to know - \ldblquote Daddy! Daddy!,\rdblquote  she cried, and felt herself being lifted off her feet. She buried her face in her father\rquote s neck and hugged him tight, this time crying with great relief. She  knew everything would be well again and had nothing to fear anymore.
