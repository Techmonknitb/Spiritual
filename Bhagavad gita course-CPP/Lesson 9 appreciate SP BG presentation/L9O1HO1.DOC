I may be imperfect, but because I understand Bhagavad-gita as it was understood by Arjuna, I am perfect. Because the knowledge I am distributing, that is not imperfect. So a postman may be poor man, but the one thousand rupees, he is delivering, that is a fact. That is not bogus thing. Because he has not manufactured something. He has received that money order from the post office. He's asked to deliver it to such and such person. His honesty is to deliver the money order as it is to the bona fide person. He is honestly carrying that money and delivering you.
\par Similarly, a guru, a guru is perfect when he delivers the words of the superior authority as it is. Then he's perfect. He may be imperfect in ordinary estimation.
